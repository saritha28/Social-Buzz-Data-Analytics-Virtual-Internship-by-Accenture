# Task 1:- Project Understanding
The brief from Social Buzz
One of Accenture’s Managing Directors, Mae Mulligan, is the client lead for Social Buzz.

She has reviewed the brief provided by Social Buzz and has assembled a diverse team of Accenture experts to deliver the project.

Mae has scheduled a project kick off call with the internal Accenture project team for tomorrow morning.

Ahead of the call, Mae has shared the project brief so you can get up to speed on what Social Buzz need help with.

Your first task is to read the brief from Social Buzz and complete a short quiz before the call. Use the brief to:

Understand the client and business problem at hand.
Identify the requirements that need to be delivered for this project.
Identify which tasks you should focus on as a Data Analyst.
Here are some key terms if you're curious: 

Note: You don’t need to know anything more about Big Data or IPOs for this program.

Big Data refers to large, diverse sets of information that grow at ever-increasing rates. It includes the volume of information, the velocity or speed at which it is created and collected, and the variety or scope of the data points being covered (known as the "three v's" of big data).

An IPO stands for Initial Public Offering - this happens when a private company becomes public by selling its shares on a stock exchange. Source: Investopedia.

# Task 2: Data Cleaning & Modeling

As we mentioned, you have been sent 7 datasets and a data model.

Often you won’t need all these datasets to find what you’re looking for.

So, the first step is to use this data model to identify which datasets will be required to answer your business question - which is to to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.

When you think you’ve identified the right data sets to include, complete the multi choice quiz to move onto the next step.

# Task 3: Data Visualization & Storytelling:-
Build your presentation Structure
Importantly, before you start creating your data charts, you should plan your presentation structure. This will ensure your presentation answers the right questions.

# Task 4: Present to the Client
Presentation tips
When presenting to the client there are a few things that you should remember:

They may not all be familiar with data, so you need to make sure you talk to them in business-friendly language.
 
You want to show them that you’ve understood their business and requirements, so use their terminology and language relevant to the task.
 
This is your time to shine and to show them how great you are! Try to present your work with confidence and conviction, if you don’t feel confident talking about your results then it’s a good indication that you don’t understand them fully or may need to revisit the dataset! Speaking about your results should feel natural when you explain what you’ve done.
 
A good presentation always takes a lot of preparation. The more you practice presenting your content, the more confident you will be when the time comes. Practice with your housemates, friends, family, anyone that is free! Ask for feedback and keep improving until you’re happy with your presentation and you’re confident in presenting your content.
